Obtain the Apache HTTP server from the location listed above, and unpack it:

tar -xzf httpd-2.x.NN.tar.gz

Likewise, obtain and unpack the PHP source:

tar -xzf php-NN.tar.gz

Build and install Apache. Consult the Apache install documentation for more details on building Apache.

cd httpd-2_x_NN
./configure --enable-so
make
make install

Now you have Apache 2.x.NN available under /usr/local/apache2, configured with loadable module support and the standard MPM prefork. To test the installation use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:

/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

and stop the server to go on with the configuration for PHP:

/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop

Now, configure and build PHP. This is where you customize PHP with various options, like which extensions will be enabled. Run ./configure --help for a list of available options. In our example we'll do a simple configure with Apache 2 and MySQL support.

If you built Apache from source, as described above, the below example will match your path for apxs, but if you installed Apache some other way, you'll need to adjust the path to apxs accordingly. Note that some distros may rename apxs to apxs2.

cd ../php-NN
./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --enable-bcmath --with-mysqli --with-gd --enable-calendar --enable-exif --enable-ftp --enable-mbstring --enable-pcntl --enable-soap --with-pdo-mysql --enable-sockets --enable-wddx --enable-zip --with-openssl --with-zlib --with-gettext --enable-intl --with-bz2
make
make install

If you decide to change your configure options after installation, you'll need to re-run the configure, make, and make install steps. You only need to restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of Apache is not needed.

Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR, various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.

Setup your php.ini

cp php.ini-development /usr/local/lib/php.ini

You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options. If you prefer having php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in step 5.

If you instead choose php.ini-production, be certain to read the list of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module. The path on the right hand side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP module on your system. The make install from above may have already added this for you, but be sure to check.

For PHP 7:
#OPTIONAL
LoadModule php7_module modules/libphp7.so


 Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP. For example, let's have Apache parse .php files as PHP. Instead of only using the Apache AddType directive, we want to avoid potentially dangerous uploads and created files such as exploit.php.jpg from being executed as PHP. Using this example, you could have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding them. We'll add .php to demonstrate.

<FilesMatch \.php$>
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

 Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:

/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
